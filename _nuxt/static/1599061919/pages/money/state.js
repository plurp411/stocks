(initial public offering), at which time they allow the public to buy shares of the company for the first time."}]},{subtitle:"Why do companies choose to 'go public'?",textImages:[{text:"Holding an I.P.O. is a great way for companies to raise capital that is very much needed to finance expansions for their growing business that private investors often aren't able to fully provide for. When a company chooses to go public, it also allows private investors to then sell their shares to the general public, and 'cash out', often making a significant profit."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\u002Fimages?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTmnOWm_NFa2Rjs3Do7O7vRglIHhZShs_Edhg&usqp=CAU",caption:a}]},{subtitle:"Why causes a company's stock price to rise and fall?",textImages:[{text:"The market moves based off of simple supply and demand.

Some will succeed, but many more than that will fail. As we will see, it is actually far more difficult than it seems to predict which companies will and which ones won't.

And year to year, half of those investors will beat the market and half will not. After ten consecutive years, that leaves us with one 'winner' who has beat the market each and every year."},{text:"The point of all this is to say that people who beat the market consistently most likely have extremely good luck, and thus do not possess any magical fortune-telling abilities as one might suspect. In fact, over the 15-year investment horizon, 92.33% of large-cap managers, 94.81% of mid-cap managers, and 95.73% of small-cap managers failed to outperform on a relative basis."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F400\u002F1*zSllutjVdI8J5ub_k5MS3w.jpeg"}]},{subtitle:"So how do I make money in the stock market?",textImages:[{text:"Well if you can't beat the market, then join the market. If we look at the history of the market year over year, the average return is right around 10%. Now this of course is the average, so some years are more or less profitable than others, not to mention that this does not account for the 2-3% or so of inflation each year."},{text:"Let's compare this now to bonds, which are basically a loan agreement between you and the government or a corporation, in which you invest some amount of money upfront, and are promised in return to be paid that amount back with interest over time. Bonds, on average, have returned an average of 5-6% versus the 10% of the stock market. That being said, there are factors such as risk which we will touch on later."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\u002Fimages?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTz5XTxrZ9v5M4Pot78mmXwuzeEKMbgEnWivA&usqp=CAU"}]}]},{index:3,id:"risk",title:"Risk It, Biscuit",date:b,contents:[{subtitle:"Why don't I put all my money in the stock market?",textImages:[{text:"Everything has risk associated with it. That's why some people choose not to bungee jump or swim with sharks, because there's always a chance that the odds are not in your favor. The same is true for the stock market. Every stock you choose has some risk associated with it, as there's always a chance that a stock, no matter how great, can fall. Remember when the housing market crashed, or when COVID-19 hit?

As we have already learned, there are no fortune tellers that can manage your money effectively using their own so-called knowledge, especially when accounting for their hefty percentage fees. That leaves us with the most important aspect of low-risk investing: index funds."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.pinimg.com\u002F564x\u002Fab\u002F84\u002Fe6\u002Fab84e6f5673c53e69d4e674463604ee8.jpg",caption:a}]},{subtitle:"What are index funds?",textImages:[{text:"Index funds are a specific grouping of individual stocks in the market. For example the Nasdaq is an index fund that tracks over 3,000 technology-related companies. Similarly, The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the 30 largest U.S. firms. These funds have much fewer fees than actively managed accounts, helping to reduce eroding on your returns."}]},{subtitle:"What's so good about index funds?",textImages:[{text:"Aside from lower fees, index funds help to diversify your portfolio, thus minimizing risk. Think about the phrase 'don't put all your eggs in one basket'. By spreading out your investment to multiple stocks, you aren't gambling away your investment all in one stock anymore, hoping it will succeed. Rather, you are diving your investment amoungst many businesses, knowing that over time the market will rise."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.makeameme.org\u002Fcreated\u002Fwhat-if-trump-5bb8fb.jpg",caption:a}]}]},{index:4,id:"pick",title:"Pick Em",date:b,contents:[{subtitle:"Which index funds are best?",textImages:[{text:"Similar to how index funds diversify individual stocks based a specific category (such as location, business type, or size), it is best to vary the funds in your portfolio to keep your risk as low as possible. For example, placing all of your investments in only U.S. stocks excludes you from overseas investments, thus making your possible losses much larger if the U.S. markets were to fall."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.tradebrains.in\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F07\u002Fstock-market-meme-24-300x173.jpeg",caption:a}]},{subtitle:"How do I choose a good balance my portfolio?",textImages:[{text:"So now that we have learned just how important diversification is, the question remains how much to diversify your own portfolio of investments. The truth is that each person's reason for investment and their own personal loss\u002Fstress threshold determines much of how they should invest."},{text:"As an example, someone who is more wealthy, who can afford risk, may choose to invest in more volatile (unpredictable) stocks hoping for a big payout. Conversely, someone who plans to save for retirement may choose to primarily invest in bonds and some large cap stocks (corporations with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more) to help minimize risk, but with a lower return."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\u002Fimages?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ1J6M-zGkky7DAxNKzXiXAAB7PsDvv2csdWQ&usqp=CAU",caption:a}]},{subtitle:"Should I invest in Bitcoin?",textImages:[{text:"Bitcoin is what we call a cryptocurrency, and there are actually many of them out there (Ethereum, XRP, Tether, etc.). Cryptocurrency is simply a digital asset that acts as a medium of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a  digital database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. And unlike banks, they are not issued by any central authority."},{text:"Because cryptocurrencies are so new, it's hard to say for sure if they are really a good investment or not. In fact, cyrptocurrency markets are actually well known for being extremely violatile, more so than just about any individual stock. This makes most savy investors weary of investing much of anything in the crypto markets, but has also created several overnight millionares."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmemegenerator.net\u002Fimg\u002Finstances\u002F81045914\u002Fwhen-its-been-90-seconds-since-youve-checked-your-crypto-balance-and-youre-not-sure-if-your-portfoli.jpg",caption:"He's Gonna Pop a Vein"}]}]},{index:5,id:"buy",title:"Buy & Sell",date:b,contents:[{subtitle:"When is the right time to buy\u002Fsell?",textImages:[{text:"Buy low and sell high. It seems simple, but as we learned before, it's essentially impossible to predict what the market will do and when (at least in the short term).

But because we know that over the long run the market has consistently risen, it would make the most sense for us to invest sooner rather than later."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fei.marketwatch.com\u002FMultimedia\u002F2020\u002F05\u002F19\u002FPhotos\u002FNS\u002FMW-IG796_421tua_20200519105502_NS.jpg?uuid=b7aa599c-99e0-11ea-bed3-9c8e992d421e",caption:a},{text:"The solution to this problem is called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). DCA is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount that they want to invest across periodic purchases of an asset in order to reduce the impact of the volatility of that asset on their overall investment. For example instead of investing $1000 all at once, it is wiser to invest ten increments of $100 over a period of time."}]},{subtitle:"Why is Warren Buffet so rich?",textImages:[{text:"Warren Buffet is extremely rich for a few reasons, but what's interesting is that 99.7% if his wealth he earned after his 52nd birthday. Rather than investing in short-term gains and trying to outsmart the market, Buffet has chosen to buy and hold his investments in long-term growth stocks."},{text:"Buffet famously said to 'be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful'.
